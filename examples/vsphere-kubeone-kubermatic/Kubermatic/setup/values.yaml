  # Depending on your chosen login method, you need to configure either an OAuth provider like
  # Google or GitHub, or configure a set of static passwords. Check the `charts/oauth/values.yaml`
  # for an overview over all available connectors.

  # For testing purposes, we configure a single static user/password combination.
  staticPasswords:
  - email: kubermatic@example.com
    # bcrypt hash of the string "password", can be created using recent versions of htpasswd:
    # `htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" PASSWORD_HERE | tr -d ':\n' | sed 's/$2y/$2a/'`
    hash: A-PASSWORD-HASH

    # these are used within Kubermatic to identify the user

    # For generating a certificate signed by a trusted root authority replace
    # with "letsencrypt-prod".
