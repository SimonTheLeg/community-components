# Connection Drops of Service Type LoadBalancer provided by MetalLB
Date of creation: 2021-07-05

## Situation
* ARP resolving at the internal tenant network 
  * requester got an ARP reply and cached it for some timeout, what get extend by a received package of the IP/MAC-Address   
* At Networks behind Firewall this caching/extending of ARP resolution didn't happen, because ARP Spoofing protection set a hard timeout. So the Firewall will enforce to send ARP request periodically after the timeout is reached
  * Together with multiple NODEs responding their IP by the ARP request, an IP change get triggered by chance (the first received ARP response wins). This behaviour could trigger the IP change and result into the seen connection drop at long opening websocket. After the client reconnect all works, as every Kubernetes Node serve the service by design. 
* To analyse it debug shows multiple macs (more see [MetalLB Troubleshooting](https://metallb.universe.tf/configuration/troubleshooting/#arping)) for the same IP:

## Resolution (so far):
* The ARP handling is a setting of the kubeproxy of Kubernetes. Kubeproxy has to modes - `iptables` and `IPVS`. As kubeproxy behaviour is at every mode different at the used `IPVS` an additional flag `strictARP` need to be set at the `KubeProxyConfiguration` config object.
* After the change every ARP request result in only one MAC of one node, constantly without rely on the "keep it stable as long as the client has traffic" behaviour.
* The testing script [`arp-status-script.sh`](./helper/arp-status-script.sh) proves that the resolved MAC is still stable after now ~24 hours.
* For more helper script see [`helper`](./helper)

After the change to the strict ARP mode, the MAC is stable resolvable:

## TODOs:
- test manual patch configmap at Kubermatic test cluster (done) - see `Manual Fix`
  - execute test setup again at customer, to see if this solves the problem
  - Result: seams to be stable and now disconnects
- **quick fix: (done)** 
- open issue at KKP and talk about "default" setting of strict mode: https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/issues/7309
- open issue at Kubeone: https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone/issues/1409

### Manual KKP Fix:
1. set cluster to `pause: true`, skip reconciling
2. In user cluster edit config map: `kubectl edit cm -n kube-system kube-proxy`, see [metallb kubeproxy IPVS settings](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/#preparation) 
```yaml
    mode: ipvs
    ipvs:
      strictARP: true
```
3. restart DS: `kubectl rollout restart -n kube-system ds kube-proxy`

### KKP Custom Addon Fix:
KKP override values by a custom addon see [kubermatic-addons/custom-addon/kube-proxy-ipvs-patch](../../kubermatic-addons/custom-addon/kube-proxy-ipvs-patch) for the kubeproxy at the customer environments.
- Create custom Addon image, see [kubermatic-addons](../../kubermatic-addons)
- Use custom addon image reference in your Kubermatic Configuration
- Update the KubermaticConfiguration - remove orig addon + add custom addon. The latest defaul values can be found at the [kubermatic github repo `docs/zz_generated.kubermaticConfiguration.yaml`](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/blob/master/docs/zz_generated.kubermaticConfiguration.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: operator.kubermatic.io/v1alpha1

metadata:
  name: kubermatic
  namespace: kubermatic
spec:
  # ...

    # Addons controls the optional additions installed into each user cluster.
    addons:
      # Kubernetes controls the addons for Kubernetes-based clusters.
      kubernetes:
        # DefaultManifests is a list of addon manifests to install into all clusters.
        # Mutually exclusive with "default".
        defaultManifests: |-
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: List
          items:

          ### some more addons
         
          ########### >>> add Custom ADDONS
          - apiVersion: kubermatic.k8s.io/v1
            kind: Addon
            metadata:
              name: kube-proxy-ipvs-patch
              labels:
                addons.kubermatic.io/ensure: true
        dockerRepository: YOUR-REPO
        dockerTagSuffix: VERISON-OF-ADDON 
```
- Apply the change KubermaticConfiguration and test user clusters are still working

**ATTENTION:** ON EVERY VERSION upgrade the operator needs to ensure that addon image and the used custom addon manifest is still match with the maintainers version, see latest for master: [github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic `/addons/kube-proxy`](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/tree/master/addons/kube-proxy)

### KubeOne fix:
Add to the kubeone addons an overwrite for the kubeproxy config file - after the cluster is created:
1. Extract current config map: `kubectl get cm -n kube-system kube-proxy -o yaml | kexp > addons/temp.kubeproxy.config.fix` (kexp just removes not needed status fields, see [fubectl](https://github.com/kubermatic/fubectl))
2. Change the values
```yaml
mode: ipvs
ipvs:
  strictARP: true
```
3.Apply the change and restart kubeproxy daemonset:
```
kubectl rollout restart -n kube-system ds kube-proxy
```

## How to find the resolving Node with MetalLB Service Type LoadBalancer
Find your service at the user cluster:
```
kubectl get svc -A | grep -i loadbalancer
```

Detect the ARP entry responding MAC:
- Connect to a worker node by `ssh` or `konsole` and ensure you are `root`
- Get the mac `arping -I ens192 10.53.18.1 -c 1 -b`
  ```

  ```
  ==> Normally only one MAC should come back, if not check the IPVs settings of the `kubeproxy` config map, see [metallb kubeproxy IPVS settings](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/#preparation)
- Find out the IP interfaces what's listen to the MAC
  ```
  arp -a | grep -i 00:50:56:AC:DC:88
  ```
