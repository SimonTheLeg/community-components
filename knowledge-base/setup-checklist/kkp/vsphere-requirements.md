# Additional Requirements for vSphere

## Access to vSphere API

For dynamic provisioning of nodes Kubermatic needs access to the vSphere API endpoint and depending on the chosen permission concept at least the following permissions:

- [Doc Permissions](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/architecture/requirements/support_policy/provider_support_matrix/vsphere/vsphere/)
- Alternative TF [kubermatic-vsphere-permissions-terraform](https://github.com/kubermatic-labs/kubermatic-vsphere-permissions-terraform)

## User Cluster / Network separation

The separation and multitenancy of KKP and there created user clusters is highly dependent on the provided network and user management of the vSphere Infrastructure. Due to the individuality of such setups it's recommended to create a dedicated concept per installation together with Kubermatic engineering team. Please provide at least one separate network CIDR and technical vSphere user for the management components and each expected tenant.

## Routable virtual IPs (for metalLB)

To set up Kubermatic behind [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/), we need a few routable address ranges. This could be sliced into one CIDR. The CIDR should be routed to the target network, but not used for machines. 

### master/seed cluster
CIDR for

- Ingress: 1 IP
- Node-Port-Proxy: 1 IP (if expose strategy NodePort), multiple IPs at expose strategy LoadBalancer (for each cluster one IP) 

### user cluster
Depending on the concept how application workload get exposed, IP's need to get reserved for exposing the workload at the user cluster side. As recommendation at least one virtual IP need is needed for e.g. an MetalLB user cluster addon + NGINX ingress. 
Note: during the provisioning of the user cluster, the IP must be entered for the MetalLB addon and the user must ensure that there will be no IP conflict.

## (if no DHCP) Machine CIDRs
Depending on the target network setup, we need ranges for:

- 3 master nodes of seed cluster
- n worker nodes of seed cluster
- n worker node for each user cluster

To provide "cloud native" experience to the end user of KKP, we recommend the usage of an DHCP. 

## Integration

### Option I - Workers only in vSphere Datacenter(s)

* Worker Node IP Range need to reach seed cluster user control plan endpoints, see [Expose Strategy](https://docs.kubermatic.com/kubermatic/master/concepts/expose-strategy/expose_strategy)
* KKP will create then a secure VPN tunnel between worker and control plan, so no way back connection need to be opened
* Existing seed need to reach vSphere API endpoints for the machine provisioning
* Application traffic get exposed at vSphere workers by the chosen ingress / load balancing solution
        
### Option II - Additional Seed at vSphere Datacenter(s)

* Seed Cluster Kubernetes API endpoint at the dedicated vSphere seed cluster (provisioned by e.g. KubeOne) need to be reachable
    * Kubernetes API Load Balancer `https` endpoint
* Worker Node IP Range needs to talk to additional `node-port` load balancer endpoint at the seed cluster
    * Additional DNS entry for dedicated vsphere datacenter seed(s) is needed e.g. `*.vsphere-dc-seed.kubermatic.example.com`
    * Workers <-> Seed communication is in the data center network only
* User Cluster users need to reach the vsphere datacenter seed cluster load balancer `node-port`
    * IP/DNS of node-port LoadBalancer
* Application traffic get exposed at vSphere workers by the chosen ingress / load balancing solution
* Host for Seed provisioning (KubeOne setup) needs to reach by the base network (e.g. a bastion host) by SSH
